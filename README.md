# u14-Emoji-Game
### ‚ö† Prototype

Emoji based game for unit 14.

```
Game name; Sharp Gunners
Objective; Last man standing
Type of fun;  Competiveness, winning, killing

About; Real time game, played on the same keyboard with 3 players. Each battles it out to be the last player alive by shooting rockets from physics based characters.
```

#### Coding
| Task | Completed/progress |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Create character with constraints, allowing it to support its self  | ‚úÖ |
| Implement keyboard controls | ‚úÖ |
| Implement shooting mechanics | ‚úÖ |
| Implement mechanics to allow the player to adjust the rotation of the character in case of it falling over | ‚úÖ |
| [CLASS: 3] Convert to classes, allowing the code to be expandable | ‚úÖ - 3/3 |
| [CLASS: 1/3] Convert character to class | ‚úÖ |
| [CLASS: 2/3] Add keystroke listeners to class | ‚úÖ |
| [CLASS: 3/3] Add team colours to class | ‚úÖ |
| [DISBANDED] Implement lives | üöß |
| Add collison detection for rockets | ‚úÖ |
| [LIVES HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED. PLAYERS MUST SHOOT THE OPPOSING PLAYER OFF THE MAP] Apply a positive force, relative to rocket speed to the part the rocket hits. ~~thus causing the opposing player to catipult in the opposite direction and loose a life~~ | ‚úÖ |
| Create the map | ‚úÖ |
| Create win/loose conditions | ‚úÖ |
| Create main menu | ‚úÖ |
| Implement win screen | ‚úÖ |
| Implement method to display controls | ‚úÖ |



#### Future ideas
| Task | Completed/progress |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Add sound effects  | ‚úÖ |
| Add cannons and other obstacles to the map  | ‚ùå |
| Do away with lives and have the rockets, gradually destroy the player by deleting the surrounding blocks it collides with | ‚ùå |
| Rocket shooter cool down - x avaliable rockets in y seconds  | ‚ùå |


#### Testing
| Task | Completed/progress |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Test with 3 players | ‚úÖ |

#### Optimization

`‚ö† | NOTE: Where see revisions is written, screenshots will be included as to prove optimization`

| Task | Completed/progress |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Converting from procedual to class based, meaning the code is expandable. See revisions. | ‚úÖ |
| Switch from `if` statements to `switch/case` statements, making the code more redable. See revisions. | ‚úÖ |
| Do away with redundent variables | ‚úÖ |
| Use ES6 modules with a seperate config.json file for settings, meaning the game mechanics can quickly be changed | ‚ùå |
| Minify code, do away with redundent CDNs like underscore - reducing load time | ‚ùå |
| Use ternary operators to increase code effeciency | ‚ùå |

#### Feedback
Ben Stotesbury; Spawn players in random locations
