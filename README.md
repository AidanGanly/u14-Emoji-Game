```

Objective; Last man standing
Type of fun;  Competiveness, winning, killing

About; Real time game, played on the same keyboard with 3 players. Each battles it out to be the last player alive by shooting rockets from physics based characters.
```

#### Coding
| Task | Completed/progress |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Create character with constraints, allowing it to support its self  | ✅ | 
| Implement keyboard controls | ✅ |
| Implement shooting mechanics | ✅ |
| Implement mechanics to allow the player to adjust the rotation of the character in case of it falling over | ✅ |
| [CLASS: 1/4] Convert to classes, allowing the code to be expandable | ❌ - 1/4 |
| [CLASS: 2/4] Convert character to class | ✅ |
| [CLASS: 3/4] Add keystroke listeners to class | ❌ |
| [CLASS: 4/4] Add team colours to class | ❌ |
| Implement lives | ❌ |
| Add collison detection for rockets | ❌ |
| Apply a positive force, relative to rocket speed to the part the rocket hits, thus causing the opposing player to catipult in the opposite direction and loose a life | ❌ |
| Create the map | ❌|


#### Future ideas
| Task | Completed/progress |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Add sound effects  | ❌ | 
| Add cannons and other obstacles to the map  | ❌ |
| Do away with lives and have the rockets, gradually destroy the player by deleting the surrounding blocks it collides with | ❌ |

#### Testing
| Task | Completed/progress |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Test with 3 players | ❌ | 

#### Optimization

`⚠ | NOTE: Where see revisions is written, screenshots will be included as to prove optimization`

| Task | Completed/progress |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Converting from procedual to class based, meaning the code is expandable. See revisions. | ✅ | 
| Switch from `if` statements to `switch/case` statements, making the code more redable. See revisions. | ✅ | 
| Do away with redundent variables | ✅ |
| Use ES6 modules with a seperate config.json file for settings, meaning the game mechanics can quickly be changed | ❌ | 
| Minify code, do away with redundent CDNs like underscore - reducing load time | ❌ | 
| Use ternary operators to increase code effeciency | ❌ |

#### Update log
| Task | Date |
